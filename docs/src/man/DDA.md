## Getting Started with the Direct Data Access (DDA)

There are two ways you can get access to all the data in the system (events + data model):

- self-managed client side billing
- fully managed

Default is self-managed approach, where your Google project gets read-only access to the data in the system. In this setup a client pays only for querying data, which is paid directly to Google via client's billing project.
