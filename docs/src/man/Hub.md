## Getting Started with the Hub

The Hub is your personal, and your product's, news page. Start your day here while drinking cup of coffee (or whatever makes you get going). It features new and important Stories and lists your favourite dashboards mixed with the most popular ones used by the rest of your team.

There's a list of annotations showing what external events have happened recently. Seeing an A/B test has started can create different context to interpreting the data you see.

Alerts, both system (if available to you) and KPI alerts are exposed here.

Lastly, it allows the team to set up couple of KPIs that are the North Star for the team, perhaps connected to your OKRs or your recent big feature.
