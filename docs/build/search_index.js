One could say this is not defined, but implicitly, it's not something we intuitivelly believe. It makes sense to say that weekly DAU is an average of daily DAU KPI.

SUM(DAU(platform)) > DAU, which makes it irregular dimension in respect to DAU and requres special handling, if we want to allow it. This could, potentially, be solved by going one step deeper on granularity level and creating something like Level User History, aka some sort of User Journey data source, which would allow easier, and correct, computation of metrics at this level.
